As a parent/legal guardian you are responsible for any payments made via credit card or other payment instrument (e.g. phone, SMS, Paypal) on the Service by a minor.</p>
<p>6.1.1      If the agreement is entered into with a PSP, SPIL Games will never be held responsible for the communication between you and the PSP, and all information that you exchange with the PSP will be subject exclusively to the privacy policy and/or other terms and conditions of that PSP.

For the avoidance of doubt, SPIL Games is not, and will not become a party to your agreement with an PSP. By using a PSP for payments on the Service you indemnify SPIL Games against reclaimed payments or other claims the PSP may have as a consequence of the non-performance of payment.

<li>if we do no longer offer the content or Service that the (balance of) the Paid Services relates to, subject to prior notice by SPIL Games to that extent;</li>
<li>you fail to comply with these Terms of Use.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no right for refund or other compensation for unused Paid Services in this respect.</p>
<p>If a Paid Service becomes unavailable following a transaction but prior to download, your sole remedy is limited to a refund of the price paid for the unavailable virtual product. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of your virtual product, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement or a refund of the price paid, as determined by SPIL Games.</p>
<p>We will accept your return of products that are <u>not</u> virtual products (e.g., virtual goods, subscriptions and game progress are virtual products) purchased through the Service as long as the products and packaging are returned in their original condition within thirty (30) days of shipment to you.
